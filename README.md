Hi there ðŸ‘‹. You're probably interested in my open source work, so here is a quick summary. I've also added a bit of work history.

ðŸ“« Please open a GitHub issue if you want to discuss something related to an open source project of mine. 

Otherwise you can reach me at gh@felixge.de.

## Open Source

### Go (2012-now)

- [dd-trace-go/profiler](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/tree/v1/profiler): Working on this as part of my job for Datadog right now.
- [go-profiler-notes](https://github.com/felixge/go-profiler-notes): In-depth research and writing on the various Go profilers.
- [sqlbench](https://github.com/felixge/sqlbench): A Go tool that measures and compares the execution time of one or more PostgreSQL queries
- [fgprof](https://github.com/felixge/fgprof): Experimental wall-clock profiler for Go.
- [httpsnoop](https://github.com/felixge/httpsnoop): Properly wraps the `http.ResponseWriter` interface in Go for monitoring.
- [go-xxd](https://github.com/felixge/go-xxd): High performance Go implementation of the xxd utility. I got nerd sniped into this.
- [godrone](https://github.com/felixge/godrone): Firmware for the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 written in Go, i.e. a flying garbage collector : ).
- [tcpkeepalive](https://github.com/felixge/tcpkeepalive): Exposes TCP keepalive knobs & dials. There are probably better alternatives now.

### PostgreSQL (2017-2020)

- [flame-explain](https://github.com/felixge/flame-explain): An [online](https://flame-explain.com/) PostgreSQL EXPLAIN visualizer written in React/TypeScript. I was very excited about this and scheduled to speak about it at various conferences, but then this pandemic thing happened and I kind of burned out on the project : (.
- [state-machines](https://felixge.de/2017/07/27/implementing-state-machines-in-postgresql/): A blog post showing how to implement state machines in PostgreSQL using user-defined aggregate functions.

### Node.js (mostly 2009-2011)

Contributed [100+ patches](https://github.com/nodejs/node/commits?author=felixge) to the core involving promises, exception handling, fs, module system, UTF-8 (including a [patch for v8](https://codereview.chromium.org/121173009/)). Mea culpa for [process.on("uncaughtException")](https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/2b252acea47af3ebeac3d7e68277f015667264cc) ðŸ™ˆ.

Additionally I wrote a lot of [NPM modules](https://www.npmjs.com/~felixge), most notably:

- [mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql): A pure JS implementation of the binary MySQL protocol.
- [formidable](https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable): A multipart/form-data parser that's pretty fast.

### CakePHP (2007-2009)

Contributed [~150 patches](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commits?author=felixge) to the core and made some good friends.

## Public Speaking

I was very active on the conference circuit for a while. You can find an incomplete [list of talks](https://felixge.de/#speaking) on my website. Going forward I'm actively looking for opportunities to present on Go profiling related topics.

## Blogging

I have an infrequently updated blog: https://felixge.de/#blog
